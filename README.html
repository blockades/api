For accessing the bitcoin server ensure that bitcoin.conf has the following options enabled.

# Listen for RPC connections on this TCP port:
rpcport=8332

# You can use Bitcoin or bitcoind to send commands to Bitcoin/bitcoind
# running on another host using this option:
rpcconnect=127.0.0.1

To have this running you need to ensure there is both a running version of cassandra and also a running version of the
bitcoin daemon

> bitcoind -daemon -reindex -txindex

Which has an index of the transactions which you are querying.
